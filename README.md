# Hackdeck
Hackdeck is my personal take on a Steam Deck-inspired hackpad â€“ a compact, all-in-one macro controller built for both utility and style. It features 6 programmable mechanical keys used for launching applications (such as discord, spotify, twitch, etc), a rotary encoder for volume or scroll control, and a crisp OLED display to show real-time feedback like current track info, system stats, or custom menus.
