# Hackdeck
Meet my Hackdeck a DIY macro pad with serious Steam Deck vibes. Built it as my own command center for music, productivity, and vibes. Itâ€™s got hotkeys for muting my mic mid-call, launching my code editor in a flash, flipping between light and dark mode, and even instantly knocking my PC out for a nap. The rotary encoder acts like a digital crown smooth volume and scroll control and the OLED? Soon to be a tiny dashboard for system stats or whatever weird stuff I dream up next.
